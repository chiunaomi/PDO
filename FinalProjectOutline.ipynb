    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looking to optimize the design of building a greenhouse around a house\n",
    "    - This is a type of solar home that helps thermoregulate using the properties of a greenhouse (mostly during the winter). This can help cut down energy costs associated with heating a house during the winter for more sustainable living. \n",
    "- Concept is based on one such house in Stockholm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30ghnDOFbNQ\n",
    "- Stakeholders: People interested in building such a structure around their houses, results can help them understand what to consider when choosing their designs and how to tune their designs for desired performance.\n",
    "- Needs: Stakeholders would be concerned about the performance of the greenhouse (why would they build one if it doesn't work?) as well as the associated costs."

    "1. Holding wall material and thickness constant (try thick/thin, insulative/conductive combinations to see if they affect results), look at the relationship between surface area to volume.\n",
    "    - Surface area affects heat flux which affects how much energy enters the greenhouse\n",
    "    - Volume affects the thermal mass which affects how drastically the temperature inside the greenhouse changes\n",
    "        - Question: Should I model with just air or have an assumptions based house?\n",
    "        - Answer: Probably should have a house since air's specific heat is too low\n",
    "    1. Calculate the daytime temperatures for summer and winter and the nighttime temperatures for summer and winter\n",
    "        - $ \\frac{dU}{dt} = \\dot{q}_{rad}*A_{rad} - \\frac{T_{in}-T_{out}}{\\frac{L}{kA_{wall}}+\\frac{1}{hA_{wall}}} $ \n",
    "            - Note: $A_{rad}$ will be approximated as 1/4 of SA for simplicity's sake (actual builds can be rotated to adjust)\n",
    "            - Note: $A_{wall}$ will be assumed to be all 5 of the greenhouse's walls (no 6th wall, just the ground, heat lost to ground is ignored)\n",
    "        - $ \\Delta T = \\frac{dU*t}{v*d*C_v}$\n",
    "            - Note: $t$ will be the length of day/night depending on the time of the year\n",
    "    2. Optimize to min $\\Delta T$ (assumes that the internal started at the ambient temperature, want minimal deviations from set internal temperature)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Repeat process holding surface area and volume ratio constant, vary wall thickness for different materials.\n"
